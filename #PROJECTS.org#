* PROJ: Inventory summarizer

  You are a rental company, and have a number of cars and trucks in your
   inventory, with different gas mileages and tank levels.  You would
 like to see a summary of your inventory, including:

  * [X] All vehicles ordered by fuel efficiency
  * [ ] All vehicles ordered by the distance they could be driven with the
    current gas tank level
  * [ ] The combined amount of gallons it would take to fill up the entire
    inventory.
  * [ ] A summary of how many of each make there are
  * [ ] A summary of how may of each model (+ make) there are
  * [ ] A summary of how many of each color there are

  You should add one script in bin/ that prompts for which summary to
  display.

  The data for the vehicles is stored in comma separated value format
  (with column headings) in the following locations:
  * data/cars.csv
  * data/trucks.csv

  You will want to use 'csv', which is part of Ruby's standard
  library.  You can learn more about how to use the library from:
  http://ruby-doc.org/ruby-1.9/index.html

  (Click on "CSV" in the middle top frame).
