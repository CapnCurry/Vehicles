* PROJ: Inventory summarizer

  You are a rental company, and have a number of cars and trucks in your
   inventory, with different gas mileages and tank levels.  You would
  like to see a summary of your inventory, including:

  * [X] All vehicles ordered by fuel efficiency
  * [X] All vehicles ordered by the distance they could be driven with the
    current gas tank level
  * [X] The combined amount of gallons it would take to fill up the entire
    inventory.
  * [X] A summary of how many of each make there are
  * [X] A summary of how may of each model (+ make) there are
  * [X] A summary of how many of each color there are

  You should add one script in bin/ that prompts for which summary to
  display.

  The data for the vehicles is stored in comma separated value format
  (with column headings) in the following locations:
  * data/cars.csv
  * data/trucks.csv

  You will want to use 'csv', which is part of Ruby's standard
  library.  You can learn more about how to use the library from:
  http://ruby-doc.org/ruby-1.9/index.html

  (Click on "CSV" in the middle top frame).

* PROJ: Better CLI (command line interface)

  The HighLine gem/library provides an easy way to ask for input from
  a user.

  * [X] Use HighLine's "choose" to make your selection menu(s)
  * [X] Use HighLine's "ask," etc instead of "gets"
  * [X] Display "errors" in red

  Install it with:

    sudo gem install highline

  See http://highline.rubyforge.org for more information.

  To see examples of HighLine being used, once you install the
  library, find where your gems are stored (if you run the following
  command, look for GEM PATHS):

    gem env

  Under the path you see, look for a "gems/highline-<version>"
  subdirectory.  In it, you should find "examples/"
